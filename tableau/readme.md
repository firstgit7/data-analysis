# 📊 Tableau Dashboard Project – Product Sales Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to **design and publish interactive dashboards using Tableau Online**.  
The goal was to transform raw sales data (`CustomerLoyaltyProgram.csv`) into **business-ready insights** that highlight product line performance, sales quantity, and revenue trends.

Through this project, I practiced the full Tableau workflow:
1. Uploading and preparing external data.
2. Building multiple worksheets with tailored visualizations.
3. Formatting KPIs and metrics for executive readability.
4. Designing and publishing an integrated dashboard.

## 🎯 Business Problem
A retail company wants to track **sales performance across product lines and years**.  
Executives need to quickly answer:
- Which product lines are performing best?
- How has sales quantity changed over time?
- What is the total revenue generated?
- Can we combine these KPIs into a single, reusable dashboard?

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** → renaming fields, formatting numbers/currency.  
- **Visualization Design** → line charts, KPI cards, dashboard layout.  
- **Business Storytelling** → aligning visuals to real stakeholder questions.
